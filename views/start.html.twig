      <p>Pay the iron price. When you play the game of thrones, you win or you die. All men must die. More pigeon pie, please. Bastards are born of passion, aren't they? We don't despise them in Dorne. The War of the 5 kings. It's ten thousand miles between Kings landing and the wall. A good act does not wash out the bad, nor a bad act the good. Each should have its own reward. I am the shield that guards the realms of men. I pledge my life and honor to the Night's Watch, for this night and all the nights to come. The bear and the maiden fair.</p>
